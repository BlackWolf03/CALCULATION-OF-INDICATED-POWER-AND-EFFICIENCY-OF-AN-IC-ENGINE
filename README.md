# CALCULATION-OF-INDICATED-POWER-AND-EFFICIENCY-OF-AN-IC-ENGINE
The designed program can be employed to calculate the Indicated Power, Brake power, Fractional Power and the Mechanical Efficiency of an IC Engine by using the inputs provided by the user. By calculating the Mechanical Efficiency of different engines and comparing them, a proper, efficient and feasible number of cylinders, mean effective power, length of stroke, area of cylinder, diameter of the cylinder bore and Crank speed can be calculated. This program can be effectively used to determine the engine specifications before designing and can also calculate the Indicated Power, Brake power, Fractional Power and the Mechanical Efficiency of an existing IC Engine.
