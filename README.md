# CALCULATION-OF-INDICATED-POWER-AND-EFFICIENCY-OF-AN-IC-ENGINE
The designed program can be employed to calculate the Indicated Power, Brake power, Fractional Power and the Mechanical Efficiency of an IC Engine by using the inputs provided by the user. By calculating the Mechanical Efficiency of different engines and comparing them, a proper, efficient and feasible number of cylinders, mean effective power, length of stroke, area of cylinder, diameter of the cylinder bore and Crank speed can be calculated. This program can be effectively used to determine the engine specifications before designing and can also calculate the Indicated Power, Brake power, Fractional Power and the Mechanical Efficiency of an existing IC Engine.
The indicated power of an I.C engine is the total power developed within the cylinder in one complete cycle neglecting any losses. It is the sum total of the brake power and the friction power of an engine.


In short it is the maximum power available from the expanding gases developed by combustion of fuel within the cylinder; neglecting frictional losses, mechanical losses and loss due to heat and enthalpy.

Which means this is the theoretical maximum and actual power developed within the cylinder that never reaches completely to the crankshaft.


 
You can measure the indicated power of an engine by using the indicator diagram or power card diagram. An Indicator diagram is taken to access the performance of each cylinder unit for an engine.

The indicated power of an engine can change under varying conditions. Thus an indicator diagram for an engine or particular cylinder is taken at a particular frequency or RPM. This can then be mechanically represented as:

The indicated power of an I.C engine:

The IP is given by:

IP = (10/6)*i*Pm*L*A*N*K


Where,
i = No. of cylinders
Pm = Mean Effective power
L = Length of stroke
A = Area of cylinder
N = Engine speed / Crank speed in r.p.m
K = Â½ = 0.5 if st = 4
K = 1 if st = 2


Now since brake power is always less than the indicated power. Mathematically you can say this as it is the result of indicated power minus the friction power. This can then be mechanically represented as:

Brake Power:

 

Where,

N = Speed of the engine in RPM
T = Turning moment which can also be given by W x L. Where W represents the brake load in Newton and L represents Length of arms in meters.



Efficiency = Brake Power / Indicated Power
